      <description>Japanese Breakfast is one of my favorite, &amp;ldquo;new-to-me&amp;rdquo; artists of the year. Not only did Michelle Zauner, the singer and artist behind the band name, release this fire album in 2021, but also she released a best-selling memoir Crying in H Mart as an ode to her mom who passed away a few years ago. I have not finished this memoir yet, and not because I don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but rather because it is so emotionally charged that I have to be in the right headspace to be able to handle the depth of Zauner&amp;rsquo;s grief that comes through in each of her words.</description>
