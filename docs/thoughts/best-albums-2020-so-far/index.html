<h2 id="spectacle-of-love-libby-rodenbough">Spectacle of Love, Libby Rodenbough</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard Mipso, you&rsquo;ve heard Libby Rodenbough sing and play violin. Honestly, I mean this as the highest complement to Libby considering how much I enjoy Mipso, but this first solo album just shows how much they had been holding her back. I love every song on this album and each listen they all grow on me even more.</p>

- &quot;Under the U-Bahn&quot;

<h2 id="women-in-music-pt-iii-haim">Women in Music Pt. III, HAIM</h2>
<p>HAIM has been hyping up this album for almost too long&hellip;it felt familiar to listen since so many of the songs had been release as singles over the last months. That being said, HAIM does not disappoint with their newest collection of bops and ballads. Have not had enough time yet for them to grow on me.</p>
