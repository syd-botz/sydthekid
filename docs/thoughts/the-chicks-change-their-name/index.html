<p>The Chicks have been known as the badass (imo), liberal, rebellious country music woman super-group. Somehow they have managed to
to be one of the biggest names in country music while being seen as always rebelling against what the
country music industry has repetively expected of them. Yet, now in 2020, they dropped Gaslighter, their latest rebellious,
angry, political album about failed love, ode to protests, and the mirror of intimate relationship gaslighting to historical
forgetting.</p>
<p>And I will be honest &ndash; I love The Chicks. They are the classic kind of country power woman group with bops for exuberant
days and ballads and angry love songs and songs that bring the waterworks (see the attached playlist for some of my favorites).
They began as a bluegrass band, working their way ups the ranks like so many others winning Best Band (?) at the Telluride
Bluegrass Festival in 1990 to playing with Beyonce in Daddy Issues at the Grammys in 2017 (?).</p>
<p>And after hearing that they dropped &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; from their name, I was momentarily excited to know they&rsquo;ve done the right
thing once again. But, lead singer Natalie Maines said, “It almost seemed like people were wondering what had taken us so long.”</p>
<p>But an act long-overdue, this changes occured in this powerful moment which is not about applauding white people for righting wrongs that should never have
happened. As the United States and world cries out and cares for the first god damn time about the deaths of Black people, like George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor and &hellip; , at the hands of police and white supremacy, applauding The Chicks for removing &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; from
their name is not enough, not appropriate, and not what this moment of pushing for true change to systems of injustice is
calling for. Black people have been fighting and calling for this kind of attention towards injustices that whiteness
has for centuries just been able to let be &ldquo;long overdue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the disastrous name change of Lady Antebellum to Lady A and the ensuing legal battle between Black, blues singer
Lady A who has been preforming under that name for 20 years and the country pop group, The Chicks changed their name
in late June by simply stating &ldquo;We want to meet the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will never argue that The Chicks are as liberal or as radical or even truly changing the music industry or a beacon that
other musicians should emulate. They truly are doing the bare minimum. Yet, the bare minimum in the past has gotten them
&ldquo;cancelled.&rdquo; Literally, in their 2003 tour in London, lead singer Natalie Maines shared her disappointment with George W. Bush&rsquo;s
involvement in the Iraq War, both as Dallas, TX, natives.</p>
<p>Way too often, these ideas of Southern heritage are reinscribed in country music as a trope divorced from the painful history
of slavery, segregation, and racism. The ability for artists to blindly &ndash; either intentionally or not &ndash; remove the history
from the usage of these tropes comes their own whiteness and oppression structures that encourage historical forgetting.
But its obvious to Black americans and those intimately familiar</p>
<p>MY ANGLE: CM needs to recokn not only with obvious forms of racism in names, ect but needs to talk back to the imagery and
history that has built their industry (not like Lady, like MO, Steeldrivers talking to the complicatedness in River Runs Red) &ndash;</p>
<p>What really does it mean that this industry flourished at a period when &ldquo;Country/Western&rdquo; was constructed against &ldquo;Race Records&rdquo; in the early
decades of the 20th century?</p>
<ul>
<li>New Yorker article says that they are indeed meeting the moment &ndash; however, i think we need to push more to truly keep
meeting the moment. In more than just name changes, but in what makes country music imagery. One could argue the Chicks
are indeed on the country-to-pop genre slide? Does this genre change make country music incomplatible with the absence of
Southern hertiage content. (no, see Mandolin Orange&rsquo;s wildfire for example)</li>
<li>CM can be seen as gaslighting those living with and through the trauma of racism when it doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the racism
of Cofederate imagery that lives today</li>
<li>not necessarily the place to talk cm to pop genre slide</li>
</ul>
<p>TOPICS TO COVER:</p>
<ul>
<li>[not done] Iraq war stance and other ways they have been at the heart of controversy that affected their career</li>
<li>[not done] Gaslighting as a form of damage that country music inflicts while using Southernness/Confederate without &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; it to reference damaging history</li>
<li>[not done] what does Dixie mean</li>
<li>[not done] summary of some of the new songs meanings (Gaslighter, March March)</li>
<li>[not done] Chicks are not the epitome of justice, but they are making waves for their audiences and slowly changing expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>RANDOM NOTES:</p>
<p>Originally, I felt a bit of joy to have them rid themselves of this Confederate imagery, but this relief was short-lived.
its seems barely enough to change your name when the industry you&rsquo;ve come from is not only riddled with these racist symbols and stories, but is built and sustained from them.
How did the dixie chicks end up with this name in the first place? After 30+ years was this the first time they critically engaged?</p>
