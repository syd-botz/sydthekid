Originally, I felt a bit of joy to have them rid themselves of this Confederate imagery, but this relief was short-lived. its seems barely enought to change your name when the industry you&rsquo;ve come from is not only riddled with these racist symbols and stories, but is built and sustained from them. How did the dixie chicks end up with this name in the first place?"/>

its seems barely enought to change your name when the industry you&rsquo;ve come from is not only riddled with these racist symbols and stories, but is built and sustained from them.
How did the dixie chicks end up with this name in the first place? After 30+ years was this the first time they critically engaged?</p>
<p>So to say, the joy was short lived.</p>
