## Bad for You, The Steeldrivers

    Notable Mentions... 
    - "I Choose You" - love song that shows the beauty of commitment in love
    - "Glad I'm Gone" - Steeldrivers never disappoint with a classic breakup song once again
    - "Mama Says No" - an instrumental that is definetely inspired by the feeling of when mama says no
    - "Lonely and Being Alone" - like they say, "there's a difference between being lonely and being alone" and that's never felt more true to me in these COVID times
## Devotion, Margaret Glaspy 
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "Killing What Keeps Us Alive"
    - "Young Love"
    - "Devotion"
## Saturn's Return, The Secret Sisters
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "Silver"
    - "Nowhere, Baby"
    - "Healer in the Sky" - this is one of those few songs that speaks faith into a faithless day or week or year
    - "Hold You Dear"
## Brother Sister, Watkins Family Hour
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "The Cure"
    - "Fake Badge, Real Gun"

## Spectacle of Love, Libby Rodenbough

If you've heard Mipso, you've heard Libby Rodenbough sing and play violin. Honestly, I mean this as the highest complement to Libby considering how much I enjoy Mipso, but this first solo album just shows how much they had been holding her back. I love every song on this album and each listen they all grow on me even more.  

    Notable Mentions... 
    - "How Come You Call Me"
    - "Under the U-Bahn"
    - "What Do You Mean"
    - "You Like It Here" - we all have a little part of us thats scared to enjoy things, this song speaks to that
## Still Flying, Bridget Kearney & Benjamin Lazar Davis
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "Endings/Beginnings"
    - "Say Something"
    - "Don't Brings Me Down"
## Punisher, Phoebe Bridgers
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "Garden Song"

## Dedicated Side B, Carly Rae Jepsen
    Notable Mentions... 
    - "Window" 
    - "Felt This Way"
    - "Let's Sort The Whole Thing Out"
## Women in Music Pt. III, HAIM
HAIM has been hyping up this album for almost too long...it felt familiar to listen since so many of the songs had been release as singles over the last months. That being said, HAIM does not disappoint with their newest collection of bops and ballads. Have not had enough time yet for them to grow on me.

    - "It Gets Easier"
