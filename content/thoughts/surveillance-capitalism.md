ok you may have heard the term "Surveillance Capitalism" dropped in the last year and increasingly in the last months as Netflix dropped its new dramatic documentary _The Social Dilemma_
and [my girl Shoshana Zuboff](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/shoshana/) who coined this term in her new influential monster of a book [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future At The Frontier of Power](https://www.volumesbooks.com/book/9781541758001) shows up all over the news and social webs to talk about
her new framework to describe a huge amalgam of our latest technical concerns.
"big data", digital advertising, social bubbles, mental health effects of social media, monopoly, privacy, and what is making our fav tech giants bajillionaires during this shitty pandemic - 
she wraps it all up in the concept of surveillance capitalism. 

but what the heck is it? i am like, future, surveillance, and capitalism in the same book title? **_a hesitant sigh from syd_**.

oh but take a deep breath, my good friend. Shoshana is here to help, not spew useless fear into our souls. Zuboff provides a framework for thinking about problems such as maintaining our ability to make
our own decisions about our future, taking down mass economic inequalities, creating safety for those who have the most to lose at the hand of private and government surveillance, and maintaining our ability to hold uncertainty as a right. Zuboff
comes across as slightly alarmist, but not without countering with good reason and hope for the future.

this is intended to serve either as an overview of her book so you don't have too read ALL 500 pages and you can still take her
concepts into your kickass world or as a supplement to help make sense of all the new terms and how they fit together.

# Surveillance Capitalism is...

(quoted from preface)

- a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales;

- a parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification;

- a rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history;

- the foundational framework of a surveillance economy;

- as significant a threat to human nature in the twenty-first century as industrial capitalism was to the natural world in the nineteenth and twentieth;

- the origin of a new instrumentarian power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy;

- a movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty;

- an expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the people's sovereignty
