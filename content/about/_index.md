syd botz (sounds like "boats"). 

i am a yarn fiber artist, a software developer, a technology culture critic, and an amateur country and bluegrass music historian based out of a lawn chair
somewhere in Minnesota. i believe in the power of dancing, asking good questions, kind company, and patience to carry us 
through mystery. i hope to teach that we need not always move toward certainty.  

i am not a banjo player (currently).
