hey syd botz here (sounds like "boats"). minnesota born and bred. i wish i could tell you where i am now, but it changes a lot in  these covid times. i am a super fan of bluegrass, country, folk, acoustic ... music. 

i am a software developer during the day and listen to music and do yarn crafts in the evening.    

and, no, i don't play the banjo but boy i do wish i could.
