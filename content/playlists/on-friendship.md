this year demanded a lot. 

honestly parts of this year i lost my way, i lost my focus on what is important to me. 

in losing myself, i have been finding my way home. 

and i am realizing that my home has always been filled with my friends.  

i end the year thankful for each of my friends. 

for different shapes of companionship.

to each of you, thank you for holding me.
